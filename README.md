# Deep Learning  (Dataset: Pneumonia)
In this project, I performed Convolutional neural network to identify patients with Pneumonia disease from their chest X-ray. The data set contains X-ray images of the chest of people with and without Pneumonia disease.  
Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia


## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
I used CNN with different filters and activation functions (relu and softmax).  

## Result
The fluctuations in the accuracy of validation set is due to small number of images in validation set (16 images). One can use portion of training set as validation set to reduce this fluctutaions.
The accuracy of the model for the test set is approximately 80%.
